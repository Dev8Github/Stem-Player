# Stem-Player
Stem Player is a lightweight desktop app for managing and mixing pre-separated audio stems like vocals, drums, bass, and instruments. It automatically detects WAV stem files by filename keywords, allows volume control, mute/solo, waveform preview, lyric generation, and exports a final mixed track.
